Aspiring cybersecurity professional with a background in IT support and a strong foundation in security best practices. Currently advancing my skills through the Google Cybersecurity course, with a particular interest in computer forensics and threat analysis. My experience as an Army medic has given me familiarity with HIPAA regulations, reinforcing my understanding of data privacy, compliance, and secure information handling.

I bring problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and a disciplined approach to cybersecurity, with hands-on experience in troubleshooting, network defense, and risk assessment. Eager to transition into a cybersecurity role where I can apply my technical knowledge, investigative mindset, and security expertise to protect organizations from evolving threats.
